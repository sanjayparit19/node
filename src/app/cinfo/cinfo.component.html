            <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is
                a 22-yard  pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at one of the wickets with the bat and then running between the wickets, 
                while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this and dismiss each batter.</p>
